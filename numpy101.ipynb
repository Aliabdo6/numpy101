    "# 💡 **Why Use NumPy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, why use **NumPy** when Python already has lists, which were covered in the **Intro to Python** lessons? 🤔\n",

    "### ⚡ **Speed**\n",
    "One of the most important reasons to use NumPy is **speed**. When working with **large arrays**, NumPy can be **several orders of magnitude faster** than Python lists. This speed boost comes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory efficiency**: NumPy arrays are stored more compactly in memory.\n",
    "- **Optimized algorithms**: NumPy uses highly efficient algorithms for operations like arithmetic, statistics, and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔢 **Multidimensional Array Structures**\n",
    "Another powerful feature of NumPy is its ability to handle **multidimensional arrays**, like **vectors** and **matrices**.\n",

    "### 🔍 **Optimized Mathematical Functions**\n",
    "NumPy comes with a wealth of **built-in mathematical functions** that are optimized for performance. These functions allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform **complex mathematical computations** quickly.\n",
    "- Write more **concise and readable code**, avoiding lengthy and complex loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, in addition to being able to access **individual elements** one at a time, NumPy provides a way to access **subsets** of `ndarrays`. This is known as **slicing**. Slicing is performed by combining indices with the colon `:` symbol inside the square brackets. In general, you will come across three types of slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ndarray[start:end]`**\n",
    "2. **`ndarray[start:]`**\n",
    "3. **`ndarray[:end]`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The **first method** is used to select elements **between** the start and end indices.\n",
    "- The **second method** is used to select all elements from the start index **till** the last index.\n",
    "- The **third method** is used to select all elements from the first index **till** the end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** In methods one and three, the end index is **excluded**. Since `ndarrays` can be **multidimensional**, when doing slicing you usually have to specify a slice for **each dimension** of the array.\n",

    "Up to now, we have seen how to make slices and select elements of an `ndarray` using indices. This is useful when we know the exact indices of the elements we want to select. However, there are many situations in which we don't know the indices of the elements we want to select. For example, suppose we have a 10,000 x 10,000 `ndarray` of random integers ranging from 1 to 15,000, and we only want to select those integers that are less than 20. Boolean indexing can help us in these cases, by allowing us to select elements using logical arguments instead of explicit indices. Let's see some examples:\n",

NumPy allows element-wise operations on ndarrays as well as matrix operations. In this lesson, we will only be looking at element-wise operations on ndarrays. \n",

To do this, NumPy provides a functional approach, where we use functions such as `np.add()`, or by using arithmetic symbols, such as `+`, that resembles more how we write mathematical equations. Both forms will do the same operation; the only difference is that if you use the function approach, the functions usually have options that you can tweak using keywords. \n",
